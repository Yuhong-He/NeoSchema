# NeoSchema
This project aims to develop a dynamic schema constraint management system based on Neo4j and MySQL, supporting triple relationships in the form of Object - Property - Value. A well-known example of such a system is [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org), which structures knowledge using a similar approach.
